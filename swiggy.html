                        <p>We achieved 150,000+ Delivery Partner logins for NYE'20 across India - <em>the highest ever in the industry</em> - ensuring we outpaced competition on everything from customer NPS to total orders.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
                        <p>On new years eve, demand on the platform doesn't just creep up by 20%. <em>It can triple!</em> Getting enough drivers online in the right zones demands meticulous planning‚Äîeverything from location-specific incentives to short-term hires.</p>
                        
                        <h3>War-Footing Execution:</h3>
                        <p>Think of it like an emergency room during a full-moon night: you need every possible lever pulled. We ramped up hiring, sweetened driver incentives, temporarily excluded slow-prep restaurants, and even limited long-distance orders to avoid overloading the network. I worked tirelessly with city teams across India, handcrafting incentive plans tailored to each city's unique demand patterns and cultural nuances. This ensured drivers felt motivated to log in exactly when‚Äîand where‚Äîwe needed them most.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Core Insight:</h3>
                        <p>New and dormant users typically return during these buzzworthy events. If their first impression is stellar‚Äîfast deliveries, zero headaches‚Äîthey're far more likely to stick with us later. These special occasions became both stress-tests and growth hacks.</p>

                    <p><span class="emoji">üí∞</span> Managed PnL strategy for Cost of Delivery (CPD) ‚Äî <em>a $400M+/year P&L item</em></p>

                        <p>We achieved the lowest CPD in Swiggy's history as we went into defense mode during the pandemic. I led initiatives that led to cost benefits of $3M/quarter.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Basics:</h3>
                        <p>Profit = Revenue - Cost. Sounds simple, but the trick is that <em>our single biggest cost</em> comes from paying and incentivizing thousands of delivery partners daily.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pandemic Reality Check:</h3>
                        <p>When the lockdown hit, food delivery demand <em>plunged by 80%</em>. Yet many drivers‚Äîoften blue-collar workers‚Äîkept logging in because it was their main or only income source. With some fixed incentive schemes and fewer orders, our unit economics tanked.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Capital Preservation:</h3>
                        <p>In an industry facing existential threats, I led cost-cutting initiatives‚Äîpay cuts, a hiring freeze, and strict budget oversight across thousands of zones.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Result:</h3>
                        <p>We stabilized CPD despite historically low demand. By the time restrictions eased, we had an operational blueprint for scaling costs back up in a more sustainable way.</p>

                        <p>We increased order share for third-party fleets by 6 percentage points (3x jump), delivering $1M+ in cost savings in one quarter (OND'20).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Why Partnerships?:</h3>
                        <p>Delivery supply is inherently "lumpy." It's like the classic "duck curve" from power grids‚Äîdemand surges at specific times (lunch, dinner, festival peak), then slumps the rest of the day, while supply of drivers is fairly constant throughout the day. Hiring more full-time drivers means idle time and wasted incentives.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Leveraging External Fleets:</h3>
                        <p>We teamed up with the likes of Shadowfax and Rapido to handle peak bursts. Our own fleet stayed leaner, so drivers had steadier earnings, and Swiggy minimized costs during off-peak hours.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Bigger Picture:</h3>
                        <p>In a marketplace, flexibility is gold. External partnerships gave us a dynamic workforce that scaled with demand‚Äîno more burning cash on idle capacity. Everyone won: customers got on-time deliveries, drivers had more sustainable shifts, and we safeguarded Swiggy's bottom line.</p>
