            <p>I love building technology that changes the way people interact with the world. My fascination for technology goes back to my childhood. I'm from a smallish city in India - Calcutta, and I was one of the few kids growing up who had access to a PC at home. My dad needed it for work and was weirdly okay with me playing with it. It wasn't just a device; it was my window to the world. It sparked a curiosity and passion that is so core to me.</p>
            <p>I started working full-time at 18 as a tax consultant's apprentice, then wore many hats—operator, founder, investor—all of which I thoroughly enjoyed!</p>
